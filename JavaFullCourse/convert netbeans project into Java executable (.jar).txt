Create a Java archive (.jar) file using NetBeans as follows:

Right-click on the Project name
Select Properties
Click Packaging
Check Build JAR after Compiling
Check Compress JAR File
Click OK to accept changes
Right-click on a Project name
Select Build or Clean and Build
Clean and Build will first delete build artifacts (such as .class files), whereas Build will retain any existing .class files, creating new versions necessary. To elucidate, imagine a project with two classes, A and B.

When built the first time, the IDE creates A.class and B.class. Now you delete B.java but don't clear out B.class. Executing Build should leave B.class in the build directory, and bundle it into the JAR. Selecting Clean and Build will delete B.class. Since B.java was deleted, no longer will B.class be bundled.

The JAR file is built. To view it inside NetBeans:

Click the Files tab
Expand Project name >> dist
Ensure files aren't being excluded when building the JAR file.
