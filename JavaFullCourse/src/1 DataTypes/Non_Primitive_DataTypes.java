Non-Primitive Data Types*******************************************

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

1) Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. 
   Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).

2) Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
3) A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.

4) A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
5) The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.


Examples of non-primitive types are 
Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.
