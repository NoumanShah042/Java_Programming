Sometimes, we have to check if the next value we read is of a certain type or if the input
has ended (EOF marker encountered).

Then, we check if the scannerâ€™s input is of the type we want with the help
of hasNextXYZ() functions where XYZ is the type we are interested in.
The function returns true if the scanner has a token of that type, otherwise false.
For example, in the below code, we have used hasNextInt(). To check for a string,
we use hasNextLine(). Similarly, to check for a single character, we use hasNext().charAt(0).

Let us look at the code snippet to read some numbers from console and print their mean.

// Java program to read some values using Scanner 
// class and print their mean. 
import java.util.Scanner; 

public class ScannerDemo2 
{ 
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{ 
		// Declare an object and initialize with 
		// predefined standard input object 
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 

		// Initialize sum and count of input elements 
		int sum = 0, count = 0; 

		// Check if an int value is available 
		while (sc.hasNextInt()) 
		{ 
			// Read an int value 
			int num = sc.nextInt(); 
			sum += num; 
			count++; 
		} 
		int mean = sum / count; 
		System.out.println("Mean: " + mean); 
	} 
}
